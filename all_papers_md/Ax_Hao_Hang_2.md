**Abstract**


We study the problem of attributing the prediction of a deep network to its input features,
a problem previously studied by several other
works. We identify two fundamental axioms—
_Sensitivity_ and _Implementation_ _Invariance_ that
attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show
that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use
the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called _Integrated_ _Gradients_ . Our
method requires no modification to the original
network and is extremely simple to implement;
it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple
of image models, a couple of text models and a
chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network,
and to enable users to engage with models better.


**1. Motivation and Summary of Results**


We study the problem of _attributing the prediction of a deep_
_network to its input features_ .


**Definition** **1.** _Formally,_ _suppose_ _we_ _have_ _a_ _function_ _F_ :
R _[n]_ _→_ [0 _,_ 1] _that_ _represents_ _a_ _deep_ _network,_ _and_ _an_ _in-_

For instance, in an object recognition network, an attribution method could tell us which pixels of the image were
responsible for a certain label being picked (see Figure 2).
The attribution problem was previously studied by various papers (Baehrens et al., 2010; Simonyan et al., 2013;

The intention of these works is to understand the inputoutput behavior of the deep network, which gives us the
ability to improve it. Such understandability is critical to
all computer programs, including machine learning models. There are also other applications of attribution. They
could be used within a product driven by machine learning to provide a rationale for the recommendation. For instance, a deep network that predicts a condition based on
imaging could help inform the doctor of the part of the image that resulted in the recommendation. This could help
the doctor understand the strengths and weaknesses of a
model and compensate for it. We give such an example in
Section 6.2. Attributions could also be used by developers
in an exploratory sense. For instance, we could use a deep
network to extract insights that could be then used in a rulebased system. In Section 6.3, we give such an example.


A significant challenge in designing an attribution technique is that they are hard to evaluate empirically. As we
discuss in Section 4, it is hard to tease apart errors that stem
from the misbehavior of the model versus the misbehavior
of the attribution method. To compensate for this shortcoming, we take an axiomatic approach. In Section 2 we
identify two axioms that every attribution method must satisfy. Unfortunately most previous methods do not satisfy
one of these two axioms. In Section 3, we use the axioms
to identify a new method, called **integrated gradients** .


Unlike previously proposed methods, integrated gradients
do not need any instrumentation of the network, and can
be computed easily using a few calls to the gradient operation, allowing even novice practitioners to easily apply the
technique.


In Section 6, we demonstrate the ease of applicability over
several deep networks, including two images networks, two
text processing networks, and a chemistry network. These
applications demonstrate the use of our technique in either
improving our understanding of the network, performing
debugging, performing rule extraction, or aiding an end
user in understanding the network’s prediction.

_factual intuition._ _When we assign blame to a certain cause_
_we implicitly consider the absence of the cause as a base-_
_line for comparing outcomes._ _In a deep network, we model_
_the_ _absence_ _using_ _a_ _single_ _baseline_ _input._ _For_ _most_ _deep_
_networks, a natural baseline exists in the input space where_
_the prediction is neutral. For instance, in object recognition_
_networks, it is the black image._ _The need for a baseline has_
_also been pointed out by prior work on attribution (Shriku-_
_mar et al., 2016; Binder et al., 2016)._


**2. Two Fundamental Axioms**


We now discuss two axioms (desirable characteristics) for
attribution methods. We find that other feature attribution
methods in literature break at least one of the two axioms.
These methods include DeepLift (Shrikumar et al., 2016;
2017), Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) (Binder
et al., 2016), Deconvolutional networks (Zeiler & Fergus,
2014), and Guided back-propagation (Springenberg et al.,
2014). As we will see in Section 3, these axioms will also
guide the design of our method.


**Gradients.** For linear models, ML practitioners regularly
inspect the products of the model coefficients and the feature values in order to debug predictions. Gradients (of the
output with respect to the input) is a natural analog of the
model coefficients for a deep network, and therefore the
product of the gradient and feature values is a reasonable
starting point for an attribution method (Baehrens et al.,
2010; Simonyan et al., 2013); see the third column of Figure 2 for examples. The problem with gradients is that
they break _sensitivity_, a property that all attribution methods should satisfy.


**2.1. Axiom:** **Sensitivity(a)**


An attribution method satisfies _Sensitivity(a)_ if for every
input and baseline that differ in one feature but have different predictions then the differing feature should be given
a non-zero attribution. (Later in the paper, we will have a
part (b) to this definition.)


Gradients violate Sensitivity(a): For a concrete example,
consider a one variable, one ReLU network, _f_ ( _x_ ) = 1 _−_
ReLU(1 _−x_ ). Suppose the baseline is _x_ = 0 and the input is
_x_ = 2. The function changes from 0 to 1, but because _f_ becomes flat at _x_ = 1, the gradient method gives attribution of
0 to _x_ . Intuitively, gradients break Sensitivity because the
prediction function may flatten at the input and thus have
zero gradient despite the function value at the input being
different from that at the baseline. This phenomenon has
been reported in previous work (Shrikumar et al., 2016).


Practically, the lack of sensitivity causes gradients to focus
on irrelevant features (see the “fireboat” example in Fig


ure 2).


**Other** **back-propagation** **based** **approaches.** A second
set of approaches involve back-propagating the final prediction score through each layer of the network down to the
individual features. These include DeepLift, Layer-wise
relevance propagation (LRP), Deconvolutional networks
(DeConvNets), and Guided back-propagation. These methods differ in the specific backpropagation logic for various
activation functions (e.g., ReLU, MaxPool, etc.).


Unfortunately, Deconvolution networks (DeConvNets),
and Guided back-propagation violate Sensitivity(a). This
is because these methods back-propogate through a ReLU
node only if the ReLU is turned on at the input. This makes
the method similar to gradients, in that, the attribution is
zero for features with zero gradient at the input despite a
non-zero gradient at the baseline. We defer the specific
counterexamples to Appendix B.


Methods like DeepLift and LRP tackle the Sensitivity issue
by employing a baseline, and in some sense try to compute
“discrete gradients” instead of (instantaeneous) gradients at
the input. (The two methods differ in the specifics of how
they compute the discrete gradient). But the idea is that a
large, discrete step will avoid flat regions, avoiding a breakage of sensitivity. Unfortunately, these methods violate a
different requirement on attribution methods.


**2.2. Axiom:** **Implementation Invariance**


Two networks are _functionally_ _equivalent_ if their outputs
are equal for all inputs, despite having very different implementations. Attribution methods should satisfy _Implemen-_
_tation Invariance_, i.e., the attributions are always identical
for two functionally equivalent networks. To motivate this,
notice that attribution can be colloquially defined as assigning the blame (or credit) for the output to the input features.
Such a definition does not refer to implementation details.


We now discuss intuition for why DeepLift and LRP break
Implementation Invariance; a concrete example is provided
in Appendix B.


First, notice that gradients are invariant to implementation.
In fact, the chain-rule for gradients _[∂f]_ _∂g_ [=] _[∂f]_ _∂h_ _[·]_ _[∂h]_ _∂g_ [is essen-]

tially about implementation invariance. To see this, think
of _g_ and _f_ as the input and output of a system, and _h_ being
some implementation detail of the system. The gradient of
output _f_ to input _g_ can be computed either directly by _[∂f]_ _∂g_ [,]

ignoring the intermediate function _h_ (implementation detail), or by invoking the chain rule via _h_ . This is exactly
how backpropagation works.


Methods like LRP and DeepLift replace gradients with discrete gradients and still use a modified form of backpropagation to compose discrete gradients into attributions. Un

**Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks**



fortunately, the chain rule does not hold for discrete gradients in general. Formally _[f]_ _g_ ( [(] _x_ _[x]_ 1 [1] ) [)] _−_ _[−]_ _g_ _[f]_ ( [(] _x_ _[x]_ 0 [0] ) [)] [=] _fh_ (( _xx_ 11)) _−−fh_ (( _xx_ 00)) _[·]_

plementation invariance.



_h_ ( _x_ 1) _−h_ ( _x_ 0)



If an attribution method fails to satisfy Implementation Invariance, the attributions are potentially sensitive to unimportant aspects of the models. For instance, if the network
architecture has more degrees of freedom than needed to
represent a function then there may be two sets of values
for the network parameters that lead to the same function.
The training procedure can converge at either set of values
depending on the initializtion or for other reasons, but the
underlying network function would remain the same. It is
undesirable that attributions differ for such reasons.


**3. Our Method:** **Integrated Gradients**


We are now ready to describe our technique. Intuitively,
our technique combines the Implementation Invariance of
Gradients along with the Sensitivity of techniques like LRP
or DeepLift.


Formally, suppose we have a function _F_ : R _[n]_ _→_ [0 _,_ 1] that
represents a deep network. Specifically, let _x_ _∈_ R _[n]_ be the
input at hand, and _x_ _[′]_ _∈_ R _[n]_ be the baseline input. For image
networks, the baseline could be the black image, while for
text models it could be the zero embedding vector.


We consider the straightline path (in R _[n]_ ) from the baseline
_x_ _[′]_ to the input _x_, and compute the gradients at all points
along the path. Integrated gradients are obtained by cumulating these gradients. Specifically, integrated gradients
are defined as the path intergral of the gradients along the
straightline path from the baseline _x_ _[′]_ to the input _x_ .


The integrated gradient along the _i_ _[th]_ dimension for an input
_x_ and baseline _x_ _[′]_ is defined as follows. Here, _[∂F]_ _∂x_ [ (] _i_ _[x]_ [)] is the

gradient of _F_ ( _x_ ) along the _i_ _[th]_ dimension.




              - 1
IntegratedGrads _i_ ( _x_ ) ::= ( _xi −_ _x_ _[′]_ _i_ [)] _[×]_



**Proposition** **1.** _If_ _F_ : R _[n]_ _→_ R _is_ _differentiable_ _almost_
_everywhere_ [1] _then_


Σ _[n]_ _i_ =1 [IntegratedGrads] _i_ [(] _[x]_ [) =] _[ F]_ [(] _[x]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[F]_ [(] _[x][′]_ [)]


For most deep networks, it is possible to choose a baseline such that the prediction at the baseline is near zero
( _F_ ( _x_ _[′]_ ) _≈_ 0). (For image models, the black image baseline indeed satisfies this property.) In such cases, there is
an intepretation of the resulting attributions that ignores the
baseline and amounts to distributing the output to the individual input features.

_since_ _they_ _are_ _based_ _only_ _on_ _the_ _gradients_ _of_ _the_ _function_
_represented by the network._


**4. Uniqueness of Integrated Gradients**


Prior literature has relied on empirically evaluating the attribution technique. For instance, in the context of an object
recognition task, (Samek et al., 2015) suggests that we select the top _k_ pixels by attribution and randomly vary their
intensities and then measure the drop in score. If the attribution method is good, then the drop in score should be
large. However, the images resulting from pixel perturbation could be unnatural, and it could be that the scores drop
simply because the network has never seen anything like it
in training. (This is less of a concern with linear or logistic models where the simplicity of the model ensures that
ablating a feature does not cause strange interactions.)


A different evaluation technique considers images with
human-drawn bounding boxes around objects, and computes the percentage of pixel attribution inside the box.
While for most objects, one would expect the pixels located
on the object to be most important for the prediction, in
some cases the context in which the object occurs may also
contribute to the prediction. The cabbage butterfly image
from Figure 2 is a good example of this where the pixels
on the leaf are also surfaced by the integrated gradients.


Roughly, we found that every empirical evaluation technique we could think of could not differentiate between ar

1Formally, this means the function _F_ is continuous everywhere and the partial derivative of _F_ along each input dimension
satisfies Lebesgue’s integrability condition, i.e., the set of discontinuous points has measure zero. Deep networks built out of Sigmoids, ReLUs, and pooling operators satisfy this condition.

(1)
**Axiom:** **Completeness.** Integrated gradients satisfy an



axiom called _completeness_ that the attributions add up to
the difference between the output of _F_ at the input _x_ and
the _baseline x_ _[′]_ . This axiom is identified as being desirable
by Deeplift and LRP. It is a sanity check that the attribution method is somewhat comprehensive in its accounting,
a property that is clearly desirable if the networks score is
used in a numeric sense, and not just to pick the top label, for e.g., a model estimating insurance premiums from
credit features of individuals.


This is formalized by the proposition below, which instantiates the fundamental theorem of calculus for path integrals.


**Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks**









_Figure 1._ Three paths between an a baseline ( _r_ 1 _, r_ 2) and an input
( _s_ 1 _, s_ 2). Each path corresponds to a different attribution method.
The path _P_ 2 corresponds to the path used by integrated gradients.


tifacts that stem from perturbing the data, a misbehaving
model, and a misbehaving attribution method. This was
why we turned to an axiomatic approach in designing a
good attribution method (Section 2). While our method
satisfies Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance, it certainly isn’t the unique method to do so.


We now justify the selection of the integrated gradients
method in two steps. First, we identify a class of methods called Path methods that generalize integrated gradients. We discuss that path methods are the only methods
to satisfy certain desirable axioms. Second, we argue why
integrated gradients is somehow canonical among the different path methods.


**4.1. Path Methods**


Integrated gradients aggregate the gradients along the inputs that fall on the straightline between the baseline and
the input. There are many other (non-straightline) paths
that monotonically interpolate between the two points, and
each such path will yield a different attribution method. For
instance, consider the simple case when the input is two dimensional. Figure 1 has examples of three paths, each of
which corresponds to a different attribution method.


Formally, let _γ_ = ( _γ_ 1 _, . . ., γn_ ) : [0 _,_ 1] _→_ R _[n]_ be a smooth
function specifying a path in R _[n]_ from the baseline _x_ _[′]_ to the
input _x_, i.e., _γ_ (0) = _x_ _[′]_ and _γ_ (1) = _x_ .


Given a path function _γ_, _path integrated gradients_ are obtained by integrating the gradients along the path _γ_ ( _α_ ) for
_α_ _∈_ [0 _,_ 1]. Formally, path integrated gradients along the
_i_ _[th]_ dimension for an input _x_ is defined as follows.




           - 1
PathIntegratedGrads _[γ]_ _i_ [(] _[x]_ [) ::=]



_∂F_ ( _γ_ ( _α_ ))



_∂αi_ _dα_



_α_ =0



( _γ_ ( _α_ )) _∂γi_ ( _α_ )

_∂γi_ ( _α_ ) _∂α_



(2)
where _[∂F]_ [ (] _[x]_ [)] is the gradient of _F_ along the _i_ _[th]_ dimension



where _[∂F]_ _∂x_ [ (] _i_ _[x]_ [)] is the gradient of _F_ along the _i_ _[th]_ dimension

at _x_ .


Attribution methods based on path integrated gradients are



collectively known as _path methods_ . Notice that integrated
gradients is a path method for the straightline path specified
_γ_ ( _α_ ) = _x_ _[′]_ + _α ×_ ( _x −_ _x_ _[′]_ ) for _α ∈_ [0 _,_ 1].

**Remark** **3.** _All_ _path_ _methods_ _satisfy_ _Implementation_ _In-_
_variance._ _This_ _follows_ _from_ _the_ _fact_ _that_ _they_ _are_ _defined_
_using the underlying gradients, which do not depend on the_
_implementation._ _They also satisfy Completeness (the proof_
_is similar to that of Proposition 1) and Sensitvity(a) which_
_is implied by Completeness (see Remark 2)._


More interestingly, path methods are the only methods
that satisfy certain desirable axioms. (For formal definitions of the axioms and proof of Proposition 2, see Friedman (Friedman, 2004).)


**Axiom:** **Sensitivity(b).** (called Dummy in (Friedman,
2004)) If the function implemented by the deep network
does not depend (mathematically) on some variable, then
the attribution to that variable is always zero.


This is a natural complement to the definition of Sensitivity(a) from Section 2. This definition captures desired insensitivity of the attributions.


**Axiom:** **Linearity.** Suppose that we linearly composed
two deep networks modeled by the functions _f_ 1 and _f_ 2 to
form a third network that models the function _a×f_ 1+ _b×f_ 2,
i.e., a linear combination of the two networks. Then we’d
like the attributions for _a × f_ 1 + _b × f_ 2 to be the weighted
sum of the attributions for _f_ 1 and _f_ 2 with weights _a_ and _b_
respectively. Intuitively, we would like the attributions to
preserve any linearity within the network.

**Proposition 2.** _(Theorem 1 (Friedman, 2004)) Path meth-_
_ods_ _are_ _the_ _only_ _attribution_ _methods_ _that_ _always_ _satisfy_
_Implementation_ _Invariance,_ _Sensitivity(b),_ _Linearity,_ _and_
_Completeness._

**Remark** **4.** _We_ _note_ _that_ _these_ _path_ _integrated_ _gradients_
_have_ _been_ _used_ _within_ _the_ _cost-sharing_ _literature_ _in_ _eco-_
_nomics_ _where_ _the_ _function_ _models_ _the_ _cost_ _of_ _a_ _project_ _as_
_a function of the demands of various participants, and the_
_attributions_ _correspond_ _to_ _cost-shares._ _Integrated_ _gradi-_
_ents correspond to a cost-sharing method called Aumann-_
_Shapley_ _(Aumann_ _&_ _Shapley,_ _1974)._ _Proposition_ _2_ _holds_
_for_ _our_ _attribution_ _problem_ _because_ _mathematically_ _the_
_cost-sharing_ _problem_ _corresponds_ _to_ _the_ _attribution_ _prob-_
_lem_ _with_ _the_ _benchmark_ _fixed_ _at_ _the_ _zero_ _vector._ _(Imple-_
_mentation Invariance is implicit in the cost-sharing litera-_
_ture_ _as_ _the_ _cost_ _functions_ _are_ _considered_ _directly_ _in_ _their_
_mathematical form.)_


**4.2. Integrated Gradients is Symmetry-Preserving**


In this section, we formalize why the straightline path chosen by integrated gradients is canonical. First, observe that
it is the simplest path that one can define mathematically.


**Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks**



Second, a natural property for attribution methods is to preserve symmetry, in the following sense.


**Symmetry-Preserving.** Two input variables are symmetric w.r.t. a function if swapping them does not change the
function. For instance, _x_ and _y_ are symmetric w.r.t. _F_ if
and only if _F_ ( _x, y_ ) = _F_ ( _y, x_ ) for all values of _x_ and _y_ . An
attribution method is symmetry preserving, if for all inputs
that have identical values for symmetric variables and baselines that have identical values for symmetric variables, the
symmetric variables receive identical attributions.


E.g., consider the logistic model Sigmoid( _x_ 1 + _x_ 2 + _. . ._ ).
_x_ 1 and _x_ 2 are symmetric variables for this model. For an
input where _x_ 1 = _x_ 2 = 1 (say) and baseline where _x_ 1 =
_x_ 2 = 0 (say), a symmetry preserving method must offer
identical attributions to _x_ 1 and _x_ 2.


It seems natural to ask for symmetry-preserving attribution
methods because if two variables play the exact same role
in the network (i.e., they are symmetric and have the same
values in the baseline and the input) then they ought to receive the same attrbiution.


**Theorem** **1.** _Integrated_ _gradients_ _is_ _the_ _unique_ _path_
_method that is symmetry-preserving._


The proof is provided in Appendix A.


**Remark** **5.** _If_ _we_ _allow_ _averaging_ _over_ _the_ _attributions_
_from multiple paths, then are other methods that satisfy all_
_the axioms in Theorem 1._ _In particular, there is the method_
_by Shapley-Shubik (Shapley & Shubik, 1971) from the cost_
_sharing_ _literature,_ _and_ _used_ _by_ _(Lundberg_ _&_ _Lee,_ _2016;_
_Datta et al., 2016) to compute feature attributions (though_
_they were not studying deep networks)._ _In this method, the_
_attribution is the average of those from n_ ! _extremal paths;_
_here n is the number of features._ _Here each such path con-_
_siders_ _an_ _ordering_ _of_ _the_ _input_ _features,_ _and_ _sequentially_
_changes_ _the_ _input_ _feature_ _from_ _its_ _value_ _at_ _the_ _baseline_ _to_
_its_ _value at_ _the_ _input._ _This_ _method_ _yields_ _attributions_ _that_
_are_ _different_ _from_ _integrated_ _gradients._ _If_ _the_ _function_ _of_
_interest is min_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) _,_ _the baseline is x_ 1 = _x_ 2 = 0 _, and_
_the_ _input_ _is_ _x_ 1 = 1 _,_ _x_ 2 = 3 _,_ _then_ _integrated_ _gradients_
_attributes_ _the_ _change_ _in_ _the_ _function_ _value_ _entirely_ _to_ _the_
_critical variable x_ 1 _, whereas Shapley-Shubik assigns attri-_
_butions of_ 1 _/_ 2 _each; it seems somewhat subjective to prefer_
_one result over the other._


_We also envision other issues with applying Shapley-Shubik_
_to_ _deep_ _networks:_ _It_ _is_ _computationally_ _expensive;_ _in_ _an_
_object_ _recognition_ _network_ _that_ _takes_ _an_ 100 _X_ 100 _image_
_as_ _input,_ _n_ _is_ 10000 _,_ _and_ _n_ ! _is_ _a_ _gigantic_ _number._ _Even_
_if one samples few paths randomly, evaluating the attribu-_
_tions_ _for_ _a_ _single_ _path_ _takes_ _n_ _calls_ _to_ _the_ _deep_ _network._
_In contrast, integrated gradients is able to operate with_ 20
_to_ 300 _calls._ _Further, the Shapley-Shubik computation visit_



Here _m_ is the number of steps in the Riemman approximation of the integral. Notice that the approximation simply involves computing the gradient in a for loop which
should be straightforward and efficient in most deep learning frameworks. For instance, in TensorFlow, it amounts
to calling tf.gradients in a loop over the set of inputs (i.e., _x_ _[′]_ + _m_ _[k]_ _[×]_ [ (] _[x][ −]_ _[x][′]_ [)] [for] _[k]_ [=] [1] _[, . . ., m]_ [),] [which]



_inputs that are combinations of the input and the baseline._
_It is possible that some of these combinations are very dif-_
_ferent_ _from_ _anything_ _seen_ _during_ _training._ _We_ _speculate_
_that this could lead to attribution artifacts._


**5. Applying Integrated Gradients**


**Selecting a Benchmark.** A key step in applying integrated
gradients is to select a good baseline. _We recommend that_
_developers check that the baseline has a near-zero score_ as discussed in Section 3, this allows us to interpret the
attributions as a function of the input. But there is more to
a good baseline: For instance, for an object recogntion network it is possible to create an adversarial example that has
a zero score for a given input label (say elephant), by applying a tiny, carefully-designed perturbation to an image with
a very different label (say microscope) (cf. (Goodfellow
et al., 2015)). The attributions can then include undesirable
artifacts of this adversarially constructed baseline. So we
would additionally like the baseline to convey a complete
absence of signal, so that the features that are apparent from
the attributions are properties only of the input, and not of
the baseline. For instance, in an object recognition network, a black image signifies the absence of objects. The
black image isn’t unique in this sense—an image consisting
of noise has the same property. However, using black as a
baseline may result in cleaner visualizations of “edge” features. For text based networks, we have found that the allzero input embedding vector is a good baseline. The action
of training causes unimportant words tend to have small
norms, and so, in the limit, unimportance corresponds to
the all-zero baseline. Notice that the black image corresponds to a valid input to an object recognition network,
and is also intuitively what we humans would consider absence of signal. In contrast, the all-zero input vector for a
text network does not correspond to a valid input; it nevertheless works for the mathematical reason described above.


**Computing** **Integrated** **Gradients.** The integral of integrated gradients can be efficiently approximated via a summation. We simply sum the gradients at points occurring at
sufficiently small intervals along the straightline path from
the baseline _x_ _[′]_ to the input _x_ .

IntegratedGrads _[approx]_ _i_ ( _x_ ) ::=

**Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks**


could also be batched. In practice, we find that somewhere
between 20 and 300 steps are enough to approximate the
integral (within 5%); we recommend that developers _check_
that the attributions approximately adds up to the difference beween the score at the input and that at the baseline
(cf. Proposition 1), and if not increase the step-size _m_ .


**6. Applications**


The integrated gradients technique is applicable to a variety
of deep networks. Here, we apply it to two image models,
two natural language models, and a chemistry model.


**6.1. An Object Recognition Network**


We study feature attribution in an object recognition network built using the GoogleNet architecture (Szegedy
et al., 2014) and trained over the ImageNet object recognition dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015). We use the integrated gradients method to study pixel importance in predictions made by this network. The gradients are computed
for the output of the highest-scoring class with respect to
pixel of the input image. The baseline input is the black
image, i.e., all pixel intensities are zero.



Integrated gradients can be visualized by aggregating them
along the color channel and scaling the pixels in the actual image by them. Figure 2 shows visualizations for a
bunch of images [2] . For comparison, it also presents the corresponding visualization obtained from the product of the
image with the gradients at the actual image. Notice that
integrated gradients are better at reflecting distinctive features of the input image.


**6.2. Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction**


Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of the diabetes
that affects the eyes. Recently, a deep network (Gulshan
et al., 2016) has been proposed to predict the severity grade
for DR in retinal fundus images. The model has good predictive accuracy on various validation datasets.


We use integrated gradients to study feature importance for
this network; like in the object recognition case, the baseline is the black image. Feature importance explanations
are important for this network as retina specialists may use
it to build trust in the network’s predictions, decide the
grade for borderline cases, and obtain insights for further
testing and screening.


Figure 3 shows a visualization of integrated gradients for a
retinal fundus image. The visualization method is a bit different from that used in Figure 2. We aggregate integrated
gradients along the color channel and overlay them on the

actual image in gray scale with positive attribtutions along
the green channel and negative attributions along the red
channel. Notice that integrated gradients are localized to a
few pixels that seem to be lesions in the retina. The interior of the lesions receive a negative attribution while the
periphery receives a positive attribution indicating that the
network focusses on the boundary of the lesion.

in gray scaee) is shown on the right. On the original image we annotate lesions visible to a human, and confirm that the attributions
indeed point to them.


**Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks**



**6.3. Question Classification**


Automatically answering natural language questions (over
semi-structured data) is an important problem in artificial
intelligence (AI). A common approach is to semantically
parse the question to its logical form (Liang, 2016) using
a set of human-authored grammar rules. An alternative approach is to machine learn an end-to-end model provided
there is enough training data. An interesting question is
whether one could peek inside machine learnt models to derive new rules. We explore this direction for a sub-problem
of semantic parsing, called **question** **classification**, using
the method of integrated gradients.


The goal of question classification is to identify the type of
answer it is seeking. For instance, is the quesiton seeking a yes/no answer, or is it seeking a date? Rules for
solving this problem look for trigger phrases in the question, for e.g., a “when” in the beginning indicates a date
seeking question. We train a model for question classification using the the text categorization architecture proposed
by (Kim, 2014) over the WikiTableQuestions dataset (Pasupat & Liang, 2015). We use integrated gradients to attribute
predictions down to the question terms in order to identify
new trigger phrases for answer type. The baseline input is
the all zero embedding vector.


Figure 4 lists a few questions with constituent terms highlighted based on their attribution. Notice that the attributions largely agree with commonly used rules, for e.g.,
“how many” indicates a numeric seeking question. In addition, attributions help identify novel question classification rules, for e.g., questions containing “total number” are
seeking numeric answers. Attributions also point out undesirable correlations, for e.g., “charles” is used as trigger for
a yes/no question.


_Figure 4._ **Attributions** **from** **question** **classification** **model.**
Term color indicates attribution strength—Red is positive, Blue is
negative, and Gray is neutral (zero). The predicted class is specified in square brackets.


**6.4. Neural Machine Translation**


We applied our technique to a complex, LSTM-based Neural Machine Translation System (Wu et al., 2016). We
attribute the output probability of every output token (in
form of wordpieces) to the input tokens. Such attributions
“align” the output sentence with the input sentence. For



baseline, we zero out the embeddings of all tokens except
the start and end markers. Figure 5 shows an example of
such an attribution-based alignments. We observed that the
results make intuitive sense. E.g. “und” is mostly attributed
to “and”, and “morgen” is mostly attributed to “morning”.
We use 100 _−_ 1000 steps (cf. Section 5) in the integrated
gradient approximation; we need this because the network
is highly nonlinear.


_Figure 5._ **Attributions from a language translation model.** Input in English: “good morning ladies and gentlemen”. Output in
German: “Guten Morgen Damen und Herren”. Both input and
output are tokenized into word pieces, where a word piece prefixed by underscore indicates that it should be the prefix of a word.


**6.5. Chemistry Models**


We apply integrated gradients to a network performing
Ligand-Based Virtual Screening which is the problem of
predicting whether an input molecule is active against a
certain target (e.g., protein or enzyme). In particular, we
consider a network based on the molecular graph convolution architecture proposed by (Kearnes et al., 2016).


The network requires an input molecule to be encoded by
hand as a set of atom and atom-pair features describing the
molecule as an undirected graph. Atoms are featurized using a one-hot encoding specifying the atom type (e.g., C, O,
S, etc.), and atom-pairs are featurized by specifying either
the type of bond (e.g., single, double, triple, etc.) between
the atoms, or the graph distance between them. The baseline input is obtained zeroing out the feature vectors for
atom and atom-pairs.


We visualize integrated gradients as heatmaps over the the
atom and atom-pair features with the heatmap intensity depicting the strength of the contribution. Figure 6 shows
the visualization for a specific molecule. Since integrated
gradients add up to the final prediction score (see Proposition 1), the magnitudes can be use for accounting the contributions of each feature. For instance, for the molecule in
the figure, atom-pairs that have a bond between them cumulatively contribute to 46% of the prediction score, while
all other pairs cumulatively contribute to only _−_ 3%.


**Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks**


diction function in the sense of Section 2. The other issue
is that the method is expensive to implement for networks
with “dense” input like image networks as one needs to explore a local region of size proportional to the number of
pixels and train a model for this space. In contrast, our
technique works with a few calls to the gradient operation.



_Figure 6._ **Attribution** **for** **a** **molecule** **under** **the** **W2N2** **net-**
**work** **(Kearnes** **et** **al.,** **2016)** . The molecules is active on task
PCBA-58432.


**Identifying** **Degenerate** **Features.** We now discuss how
attributions helped us spot an anomaly in the W1N2 architecture in (Kearnes et al., 2016). On applying the integrated gradients method to this network, we found that
several atoms in the same molecule received identical attribution despite being bonded to different atoms. This is
surprising as one would expect two atoms with different
neighborhoods to be treated differently by the network.


On investigating the problem further, in the network architecture, the atoms and atom-pair features were not fully
convolved. This caused all atoms that have the same atom
type, and same number of bonds of each type to contribute
identically to the network.


**7. Other Related work**


We already covered closely related work on attribution in
Section 2. We mention other related work. Over the last
few years, there has been a vast amount work on demystifying the inner workings of deep networks. Most of this
work has been on networks trained on computer vision
tasks, and deals with understanding what a specific neuron computes (Erhan et al., 2009; Le, 2013) and interpreting the representations captured by neurons during a prediction (Mahendran & Vedaldi, 2015; Dosovitskiy & Brox,
2015; Yosinski et al., 2015). In contrast, we focus on understanding the network’s behavior on a specific input in
terms of the base level input features. Our technique quantifies the importance of each feature in the prediction.


One approach to the attribution problem proposed first
by (Ribeiro et al., 2016a;b), is to locally approximate the
behavior of the network in the vicinity of the input being
explained with a simpler, more interpretable model. An
appealing aspect of this approach is that it is completely
agnostic to the implementation of the network and satisfies
implemenation invariance. However, this approach does
not guarantee sensitivity. There is no guarantee that the
local region explored escapes the “flat” section of the pre


Attention mechanisms (Bahdanau et al., 2014) have gained
popularity recently. One may think that attention could be
used a proxy for attributions, but this has issues. For instance, in a LSTM that also employs attention, there are
many ways for an input token to influence an output token: the memory cell, the recurrent state, and “attention”.
Focussing only an attention ignores the other modes of influence and results in an incomplete picture.


**8. Conclusion**


The primary contribution of this paper is a method called
integrated gradients that attributes the prediction of a deep
network to its inputs. It can be implemented using a few
calls to the gradients operator, can be applied to a variety
of deep networks, and has a strong theoretical justification.


A secondary contribution of this paper is to clarify desirable features of an attribution method using an axiomatic
framework inspired by cost-sharing literature from economics. Without the axiomatic approach it is hard to tell
whether the attribution method is affected by data artifacts, network’s artifacts or artifacts of the method. The
axiomatic approach rules out artifacts of the last type.


While our and other works have made some progress on
understanding the relative importance of input features in
a deep network, we have not addressed the interactions
between the input features or the logic employed by the
network. So there remain many unanswered questions in
terms of debugging the I/O behavior of a deep network.

**A. Proof of Theorem 1**


_Proof._ Consider a non-straightline path _γ_ : [0 _,_ 1] _→_ R _[n]_

from baseline to input. W.l.o.g., there exists _t_ 0 _∈_ [0 _,_ 1]
such that for two dimensions _i, j_, _γi_ ( _t_ 0) _>_ _γj_ ( _t_ 0). Let
( _t_ 1 _, t_ 2) be the maximum real open interval containing _t_ 0
such that _γi_ ( _t_ ) _>_ _γj_ ( _t_ ) for all _t_ in ( _t_ 1 _, t_ 2), and let _a_ =
_γi_ ( _t_ 1) = _γj_ ( _t_ 1), and _b_ = _γi_ ( _t_ 2) = _γj_ ( _t_ 2). Define function
_f_ : _x_ _∈_ [0 _,_ 1] _[n]_ _→_ _R_ as 0 if min( _xi, xj_ ) _≤_ _a_, as ( _b −_ _a_ ) [2]

if max( _xi, xj_ ) _≥_ _b_, and as ( _xi_ _−_ _a_ )( _xj_ _−_ _a_ ) otherwise.
Next we compute the attributions of _f_ at _x_ = _⟨_ 1 _, . . .,_ 1 _⟩n_
with baseline _x_ _[′]_ = _⟨_ 0 _, . . .,_ 0 _⟩n_ . Note that _xi_ and _xj_ are
symmetric, and should get identical attributions. For _t_ _∈/_

[ _t_ 1 _, t_ 2], the function is a constant, and the attribution of _f_
is zero to all variables, while for _t_ _∈_ ( _t_ 1 _, t_ 2), the integrand
of attribution of _f_ is _γj_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _a_ to _xi_, and _γi_ ( _t_ ) _−_ _a_ to _xj_,
where the latter is always strictly larger by our choice of
the interval. Integrating, it follows that _xj_ gets a larger
attribution than _xi_, contradiction.


**B. Attribution Counter-Examples**


We show that the methods DeepLift and Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) break the implementation invariance axiom, and the Deconvolution and Guided backpropagation methods break the sensitivity axiom.


Figure 7 provides an example of two equivalent networks

DeepLift _x_ 1 = 2 _,_ _x_ 2 = _−_ 1
LRP _x_ 1 = 2 _,_ _x_ 2 = _−_ 1


_Figure 7._ **Attributions** **for** **two** **functionally** **equivalent** **net-**
**works** . The figure shows attributions for two functionally equivalent networks _f_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) and _g_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) at the input _x_ 1 = 3 _,_ _x_ 2 =
1 using integrated gradients, DeepLift (Shrikumar et al., 2016),
and Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) (Binder et al.,
2016). The reference input for Integrated gradients and DeepLift
is _x_ 1 = 0 _,_ _x_ 2 = 0. All methods except integrated gradients
provide different attributions for the two networks.


_f_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) and _g_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) for which DeepLift and LRP yield
different attributions.


First, observe that the networks _f_ and _g_ are of the
form _f_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) = ReLU( _h_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2)) and _f_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) =
ReLU( _k_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2)) [3], where


_h_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) = ReLU( _x_ 1) _−_ 1 _−_ ReLU( _x_ 2)
_k_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) = ReLU( _x_ 1 _−_ 1) _−_ ReLU( _x_ 2)


Note that _h_ and _k_ are not equivalent. They have different values whenever _x_ 1 _<_ 1. But _f_ and _g_ are equivalent.
To prove this, suppose for contradiction that _f_ and _g_ are
different for some _x_ 1 _, x_ 2. Then it must be the case that
ReLU( _x_ 1) _−_ 1 = ReLU( _x_ 1 _−_ 1). This happens only when
_x_ 1 _<_ 1, which implies that _f_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) = _g_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) = 0.


Now we leverage the above example to show that Deconvolution and Guided back-propagation break sensitivity. Consider the network _f_ ( _x_ 1 _, x_ 2) from Figure 7. For a fixed
value of _x_ 1 greater than 1, the output decreases linearly
as _x_ 2 increases from 0 to _x_ 1 _−_ 1. Yet, for all inputs, Deconvolutional networks and Guided back-propagation results in zero attribution for _x_ 2. This happens because for
all inputs the back-propagated signal received at the node
ReLU( _x_ 2) is negative and is therefore not back-propagated
through the ReLU operation (per the rules of deconvolution and guided back-propagation; see (Springenberg et al.,
2014) for details). As a result, the feature _x_ 2 receives zero


3 ReLU( _x_ ) is defined as max( _x,_ 0).
